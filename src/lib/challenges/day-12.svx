It's time to start sending out Christmas cards to ensure they arrive in time for Christmas Day, but with the added rush at the North Pole no one has had time to design a card! Santa has requested the creation of a digital Christmas card creator.

Your mission is to build an interactive application that allows users to design their own Christmas cards with ease. Embrace the festive spirit and Svelte's capabilities to create a tool where elements can be effortlessly dragged, dropped, and arranged into beautiful holiday greetings.

The elves have drawn some decorations for use in your Christmas card creator. Feel free to add more drawings if youâ€™d like! Implement an intuitive drag-and-drop interface where users can select, move, and place elements anywhere on the card. 

If you're up to the task, you could also allow users to add personalized messages with different fonts, sizes, and colors. Include festive font styles to enhance the holiday feel. Google Fonts has some fonts that suit santas taste!
