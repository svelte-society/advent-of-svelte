On a brisk, starry night at the North Pole, Santa stumbled upon a peculiar and enchanting discovery. Hidden beneath a pile of old maps in his study, he found a mysterious deck of playing cards. But this was no ordinary deck â€“ it consisted of exactly 24 cards, each with a duplicate, adorned with intricate and whimsical designs unknown to Santa.

Intrigued by this mysterious find, Santa, known for his love of puzzles and games, saw an opportunity for a delightful pre-Christmas activity. He decided to turn this Deck of Doubles into a memory game, a fun way to keep himself and Mrs. Claus sharp during the bustling holiday season.

Your challenge is to bring Santa's idea to life by creating a digital memory game based on this magical deck.
The game involves flipping over two cards at a time, with the aim of finding matching pairs. The challenge lies in remembering where each card and its twin are located.

Integrate a timer to track how quickly players can match all pairs, adding a sense of urgency and excitement to the game.
